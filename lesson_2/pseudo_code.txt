1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

a) casual

Define a method with two parameters (numbers).
Add the two numbers together.
Return the value.

b) formal

START

Define a method with two parameters: number1 and number2.
Add number1 and number2 together.
The method automatically returns the last evaluated expression.

END


2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

a) casual
Given a collection of strings.
(Could just use a method for joining all the elements.)
Save an empty variable to add to later
Loop through the collection, adding each element to the variable.
After the loop return the variable

b) formal

START

# Given a collection of strings called "strings"

SET output = ''
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of strings
  SET output = output with value of current element at space "iterator" in strings collection

return output (this isn't technically necessary, as the last evaluation returns)

END


3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

a) casual
Given a collection of integers.
Make a new empty collection.
Loop through the collection and if the index is even add it to the new collection.
Return the new collection.

b) formal

START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 0
SET output = []
WHILE iterator < length of numbers
  IF number at space "iterator" is even
    Add the number at space "iterator" to the output collection

Return the output.
